### What is ggplot2? 

* ggplot2 is a visualization package part of tidyverse. 

* ggplot2 follows the Grammar of Graphics (GoG) [Create elegant data visualizations using the grammar of graphics, ggplot2]  (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

* The idea is to build graphs from the following components:

* Check out the https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#ggplot2


### Arguments for ggplot2 funtions:
* Aesthetics (Visual properties of the objects in your plot, e.g. size, shape, color, patern, fill of variables, alpha)
* Geoms (Geometric objects representing data, lines, bars, points)
* Facets (subgroups)
* Statistics (additional functions like regression lines)
* Scales (legends and labels)
* Coordinate System (Cartesian, polar..)
* Themes (Background)


## Let's install/load tidyverse!

The very first time you want to use a package you first need to install it.  
```{r}
# if you have never downloaded tidyverse uncomment the line below and run to install it
#install.packages('tidyverse')
```

Load tidyverse
```{r load_tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```


#### Let's learn ggplot2 with some wine  
  
* [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): 

* We will use last week's dataset. We can use this line of code to read in the  data from the github page. 

```{r load wine csv file}
wine_ratings <- read_csv('WineRatings.csv')
```

We use the View function to look at your dataframe and check that we have tidy data (each variable is a column and each observation is a row)
```{r view data, eval=FALSE}
View(wine_ratings)
```

We can delete X1.
```{r delete column}
wine_ratings<-select(wine_ratings, -X1)
```

Let's create a few graphs using ggplot2.
```{r The first layer is the data} 
ggplot(data=wine_ratings)
```


Now we need to add aesthetics and geometric objects.
aes is what you plot (point, line, bar, boxplot), and geoms are how you plot aes (y, x, size, color, fill, shape
specify aes() inside each geom_() so that we know which aes correspond to each geoms

```{r Adding geom() and aes()} 
ggplot(data=wine_ratings)+
  geom_point(aes(x=points,
                 y=price))
```

I am going to create a new data frame to compare Spain and the U.S. We will focus on cheap wine
```{r Creating a new data frame for Spain and the United Staets}

Spain_and_US<- filter(wine_ratings, country %in% c("US","Spain"), price<500)
```

Let's add facets
```{r Adding geom_() and aes()} 
ggplot(data=Spain_and_US)+
  geom_point(aes(x=points,
                 y=price))+
  facet_wrap(~country)
```

Let's add a stat layer
```{r Adding a regression line} 
ggplot(data=Spain_and_US)+
  geom_point(aes(x=points,
                 y=price))+
  facet_wrap(~country)+
  stat_smooth(aes(x=points, y=price), method="lm", formula = y ~ x)
```


```{r another way to do the same}
p<-ggplot(Spain_and_US, aes(x=points, y=price))+geom_point()+facet_grid(~country)

p+stat_smooth(method="lm", formula = y ~ x)

  
  
```




Changing the theme
```{r Changing the theme} 
ggplot(data=Spain_and_US)+
  geom_point(aes(x=points,
                 y=price, color=country))+
  theme_minimal()

                 
```




Adding Labels
```{r adding adding labels}
ggplot(data=Spain_and_US)+
  geom_point(aes(x=points,
                 y=price, color=country))+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Wine Scores and Price",
       x="Expert Scores",
       y= "Price")
```


Changing Legends
```{r Legends}
ggplot(data=Spain_and_US)+
  geom_point(aes(x=points,
                 y=price, color=country))+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Wine Scores and Price",
       x="Score",
       y= "Price")+
  scale_color_discrete(name="Country", labels= c("Spain", "United States"))

```



If you would like to play with other themes, try the ggthemes package!
```install.packages('ggthemes')```
```library(ggthemes)```
```+theme_tufte()```
```+theme_fivethirtyeight()```
```+theme_economist()```
```+theme_wsj()```
```+theme_solarized()```

* [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): 
  * This week is Ramen Ratings data. #TidyTuesday Twitter 
```{r #TidyTuesday}
ramen_ratings <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-06-04/ramen_ratings.csv")

```
