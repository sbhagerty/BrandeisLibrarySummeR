# Brandeis Library SummeR of R

This is the repo for the Brandeis SummeR of R series. A weekly series offerred on Tuesdays and Thursdays that will be 12-1:30 in Gerstenzang 135.

Each session will start with a 30 minute tutorial and then in the following hour  you can apply what we've learned or work on your own project with R, with experienced R users around to help troubleshoot (and maybe also commiserate a little) when you get stuck! 

Please use the registration links below to sign up. Tuesday and Thursday sessions are the same each week. Contact [Shannon Hagerty](mailto:shannonhagerty@brandeis.edu) or [Margarita Corral](mailto:mcorral@brandeis.edu) if you have any questions.
