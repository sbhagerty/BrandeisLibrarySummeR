## Reproducibility Tips for R

*Keep it all together*  

- R scripts should contain all code
- load all packages at the top of scripts
- Use R projects 
-  Start analyses with clear environments, restart R sessions (Under Session Menu -> restart R)  

*Make it readable*  

  - Use meaningful variable names 
  - Document (either by commenting or in Rmarkdown) your code, explaining what and why
  - Break Analysis into chunks with separate R files
  - Use functions if you are repeating the same task multiple times
